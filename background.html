<h2>Family background</h2>
<p>I come from a family of a very hardworking individuals.
    My grandfather a once civil worker and a secondary school teacher, was a very focused man who alway knew and fought for what he stood 
    for. My father on the other hand carries along with him all his fathers adorable traits but is a more compassionate and careful man
     who raised me to always be careful and keep only the people that matter around me.
     I know and love what i stand for and really hope i can share this with the world. Thank you.
